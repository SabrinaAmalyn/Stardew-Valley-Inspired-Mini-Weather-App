3. Retrieves current weather data using the OpenWeather Current Weather API.

4. Maps weather condition codes to custom Stardew Valley‚Äìstyle icons for a playful, game-inspired look.

5. Validates input and displays alerts for empty or invalid entries.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This project was created primarily to practice JavaScript, especially API usage and DOM manipulation. Web responsiveness and mobile layout adjustments were not included in this version. If I had more time, I‚Äôd love to add the Stardew Valley weather forecaster and his quirky commentary to really bring the theme to life and make the experience even more fun. I encourage you to try adding it yourself‚Äîit's a great way to make the project uniquely yours and take it to the next level!
